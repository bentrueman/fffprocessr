\item{s}{A vector of guesses for peak standard deviations, with length equal to the desired number of peaks.}

\item{g}{A vector of guesses for peak shape parameters, with length equal to the desired number of peaks.}

\item{fn}{Function for peak fitting: skew Gaussian or exponentially modified Gaussian ("skew_gaussian" or "emg").}

\item{algorithm}{Refer to nls() in the 'stats' package.}
